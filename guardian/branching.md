# Developer Workflow

## Feature

All development must be done in feature branches, a git branch that contains only the changes for a single feature.
This is the most important rule.
The feature branch must only contain changes for the feature, it cannot contain any other changes.
If you ever feel you need to break this rule, get approval first.
To ensure it only contains the feature changes, always create feature branches off of master.
These are named based on the feature and should contain a reference to a ticket or issue number.
For example, SKY-12345-video-upload-simulator.

## QA

Once the development is complete and ready for code review a pull request should be issued into the qa branch.
The qa branch will always exist and is a collection of all feature branches for the next release.
Feature branches are merged into qa after they pass code review.
Once the branch has been merged into qa the continuous integration server will deploy the latest changes to the staging server.
This allows the QA team to test all the feature branches together, what will become the next release.

## Release

Once all the features have been completed for the next release and the qa branch is thoroughly tested, it is merged into master.
Note that during the development process all the feature branches still exist, they are not deleted once they are merged into qa.
This is important when we need to pull a feature from a release.
The master branch represents the current state of production.
Every release will have a tag, but master can always be used to reference current production code.
No changes are made directly to master, nor are feature branches ever merged directly into master.
Only qa is ever merged into master, this happens during the release process.
After a release is tagged and pushed out to production, all the merged feature branches are removed.
To make merging seamless, feature branches should always be kept up to date with master.
If you have an ongoing feature branch that is behind master it must be rebased before being merged into qa.
This ensures there aren't any merge conflicts when we make the release.
In terms of developer responsibility, you only have to worry about making feature branches, merging them into qa, and rebasing against master.
The rest of the process is handled by operations personnel.
If you ever want to see the state of your feature branch relative to master you can view it on the /branches page on github.
There will be a small graph of commits ahead and behind of master.
Your feature branch should always be 0 commits behind and X commits ahead, where X is the number of commits in your feature branch.

## Notes:

This Sucks for developers ^
Keeping feature branches open is expensive for developers (rebase, merge conflict resolution)

Feature branches should be thrown away...

Features should *never* be pulled from QA since the feature branch should have been tested and approved already.
- If a feature is removed, a new commit should be made to remove the feature
- If the feature is restored, the feature is still in git history and can be restored
- Need to provide an example of this
- We should not be regularly backing out features after development is done and a PR is merged. If this is occuring
  planning needs to be improved.

Decisioning
Feature branch needs QA?
- Yes. QA tests the feature branch prior to merge into develop
  - If the feature being tested requires multiple branches then *developers* should create a new branch the merges both branches
    and create a pull request. QA should never merge.
- No. PR merged into develop

Release testing should be limited to integration/regression testing (the feature should have been fully tested already)
